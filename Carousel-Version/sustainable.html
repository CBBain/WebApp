            <div class="content">
              <p>1. No Poverty – To bring basic human needs to everyone such as access to food, shelter and sanitation. Today, as many as 10% of people in the world are still living under the poverty line, estimated to be as high as 7% by 2030. In
                Dundee, as many as a third of children are living in poverty. The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated the issue of poverty. <br><a href="https://cpag.org.uk/scotland">CPAG Scotland</a></p>

            <div class="content">
              <p>2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture - This sustainable development goal is important as it not only covers ending hunger but to allow people to continue to feed themselves
                self-sufficiently and reliably, without destroying the land in the process. In the 6 years from 2014-2020 we have seen an increase in malnourished people, from 607 million people to as many as 811 million.<br><a

                jobs and equal, to allow women in positions of power and to protect them from increasing domestic violence.<br><a href="http://www.dundeewomensaid.co.uk/ ">Dundee Women's Aid</a> </p>

            <div class="content">
              <p>Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all – This development goal is very important because as of 2018 2.2 billion people were living in water-stressed regions. In the last century water usage has
                been increasing at twice the rate of the population. It must be ensured that everyone has universal access to clean-safe water whether it be for drinking, washing or cleaning.<br><a href="https://www.wateraid.org/uk/">WaterAid</a></p>

                given how important electricity is in todays connected world this statistic is quite staggering. Not only should we be aiming to provide electricity to people that don’t have it but should also be providing more sustainable and
