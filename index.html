          <!--Description.-->
          <p>It is a stark reality that many low-income families struggle to provide meals during school holidays, as well as other basics for their children, such as clothing and stimulating opportunity.

            This is especially prevalent in Dundee City where over 1/3 of children are living in poverty.

            We are a children’s charity, supporting community projects that are in areas of high multiple deprivation to target the most vulnerable children.

            Our primary cause is to challenge food inequality for children and to provide nutritious meals, as well as other basic needs, thus reducing pressure on parents to provide and helping to boost community cohesion.

            We pride ourselves on being agile, responsive and adaptable to the provision of basic needs for children and families.

          <!--Description.-->
          <p>DIWC seeks to engage, educate and empower women from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds, to help them achieve their personal goals.

            We provide educational, recreational and social activities, as well as employment training, information and advice services for disadvantaged and/or excluded women from over sixty countries.

            DIWC works in partnership with many organisations to promote the personal development of women, by encouraging active participation, leadership and citizenship in society.

            What do we do?
            DIWC provides opportunities for marginalised and socially excluded women, with an emphasis on those from BME (Black and Minority Ethnic) and migrant communities, to reach their full potential and prosper in their communities.

            DIWC is unique in Dundee as the only multicultural, 'women-only' organisation, which does not follow a single faith and/or cultural belief as part of the aim or service provision.

            As a result of its many years of experience, DIWC has built a positive reputation within the communities it supports, being an organisation which is sensitive and respectful towards diverse cultural needs.

            In order to meet our aims, DIWC provides a range of services such as: classes, social groups, informal and formal training, employment training, volunteering, events and issue based awareness-raising.

            In addition, our social enterprise business, Rise and Shine Childcare, has gone from strength to strength and has provided thousands of employment opportunities to women across the city.

            DIWC is a grassroots organisation and sees it future as continuing to provide and develop services led by community needs and underpinned by our values.

          <!--Description.-->
          <p>In November 2017, MVV entered into a contract with Dundee City and Angus Councils to manage their residual waste (that is waste left over after recyclable materials have been removed). It is a long-term contract under which MVV will take over and operate the existing energy from waste facility in Baldovie while building a new, modern facility next door.</p>

          <p>The new facility will use around 110,000 tonnes of residual waste per year to generate electricity. It will also aim to fulfil the requirements of the Scottish Government’s hierarchical Zero Waste priorities on
            1. reduce
            2. reuse
            3. recycling
            4. recovery (of energy for example)
            5. disposal</p>

          <p>Planning permission was granted by Dundee City Council on 24th March 2017. In November 2020, SEPA approved MEB’s application to vary the environmental permit to allow parallel operation of the current facility and the new EfW CHP facility. Collectively, these facilities have created an additional 30 jobs on sites and have a capacity of processing approximately 200,000 tonnes of residual waste per annum.</p>

          <p>Dundee Refugee Support is a local project by people living in Dundee. It is a registered charity under the umbrella name Dundee the Caring City and is based at our warehouse in the north of the city. We are entirely volunteer ran and regularly ship clothing and hygiene aid to refugee camps and distribution warehouses abroad. We also provide goods for all newly resettled families in Dundee who come up to the warehouse to get what they need when they arrive and beyond. We work with other local groups and beyond, to music labels and sports organisations. In the past two years, we have shipped containers of aid to Lebanon, Serbia, Greece and France and have contributed to many more including loads to Syria and Iraq. We wouldn’t exist if wasn’t for the tonnes and tonnes of donations we receive from the local community and the many hours everyone puts in!

      <!--Description.-->
      <p>In Dundee in 1881, Miss Mary Ann Baxter and her cousin, John Boyd Baxter - two of the famous Baxter family, who made their money from the Jute mills of the city - donated £140,000 to the creation of a college in Dundee. This was the beginning of the University of Dundee.

        From the start it was an institution that stood out. Instead of professors with ivory tower backgrounds, it employed bright young people who realised that to compete in the modern world, Great Britain needed to improve its technological output. William Peterson, who was a Latinist and Scholar, became the inaugural Principal in 1882 at the tender age of 26. Patrick Geddes, who didn’t have a degree, was professor of botany and one of the foremost thinkers in the world.

        Central to the institution's founding deed was that it should be used for "promoting the education of persons of both sexes, and the study of science, literature, and the fine arts”.</p>
